Repeat Landscape

This is a series of scripts to create stunning visualizations from repeats identified by RepeatMasker, the *.align.out file is parsed and converted to a *.csv file, which can be plotted in stacked-histogram or colour-full pies with R or Google Charts API.

*NOTE: RepeatMasker main package (4.0.5+) contains an updated version of RepeatLandscape, you should use that one.
